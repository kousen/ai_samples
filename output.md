Estimating the number of stars in the universe is a complex task due to the vast distances and the limitations of current telescopic technology. However, based on recent estimates and observations, here are some approximate numbers:

1. **Galaxy Estimates**: Astronomers estimate there are approximately 100 billion to 200 billion galaxies in the observable universe.
2. **Stars per Galaxy**: The average galaxy is estimated to have about 100 billion stars.
3. **Total Stellar Population**: Combining these estimates, the total number of stars in the observable universe is roughly 70 billion trillion (7 x 10^22) stars. However, more recent estimates suggest there could be three times more stars due to the presence of many more red dwarf stars.
4. **Detailed Calculation**: Using the Milky Way as a model, with about 100 billion stars, and multiplying by the estimated number of galaxies (2 trillion), gives an astonishing number of approximately 200 billion trillion stars (200 sextillion).

These numbers are subject to change as new observations and technological advancements reveal more about the universe. The actual number could be even higher, given the limitations of current detection capabilities.
